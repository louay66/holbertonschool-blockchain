## Introduction

Blockchain technology is revolutionizing various industries by providing decentralized and transparent solutions. Understanding the underlying concepts and building blocks of blockchain infrastructure is crucial for anyone interested in this field.

This repository aims to provide a collection of projects that explore different aspects of blockchain infrastructure. Each project focuses on a specific topic and includes code examples, explanations, and resources to help you learn and implement blockchain concepts from scratch.

## Projects

Here is a list of projects included in this repository:

1. **Cryptography**: This project covers various cryptographic algorithms and techniques used in blockchain systems, such as hashing, digital signatures, and encryption.

2. **Data Structures**: Explore the data structures commonly used in blockchain technology, including Merkle trees, linked lists, and hash tables. These data structures are essential for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of a blockchain network.

3. **Transactions**: Learn about the structure and validation of transactions in a blockchain. This project covers topics like transaction inputs and outputs, transaction scripts, and transaction verification.

4. **CLI**: Build a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with a blockchain network. This project demonstrates how to send transactions, query blocks, and perform other common operations through a command-line interface.

Feel free to explore each project and delve deeper into the specific aspects of blockchain infrastructure that interest you.
